This is a 2D RPG fantasy game. I started this over the summer as a way to get experience and make something cool, I experimented with a lot of things. The game is still in development. Currently working on the ability to pick up equipable
items and being able to equip them. There are certain game objects that I have developed that are deactivated right now, such as an enemy "the spider". You can find all the game objects in the prefabs folder.

I have a friend who is a write helping me with me the story, but everything is on pause right now because of school, and other responsibilities.
